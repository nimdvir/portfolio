## RESEARCH INTERESTS


My research interests center around users' adaptation and use of novel
communication technology. My primary research focuses on human
interaction with embodied conversational agents and chat bots, and the
influence of those chat bots on users' feelings and behavior toward
those systems.

I also study users' adaptation to intelligent systems designed to detect
deception. I am interested to learn how people adapt their behavior,
either consciously or unconsciously, as they interact with novel
systems. I focus on a design science methodology following the Last
Research Mile philosophy. Much of my research involves laboratory
experiments.
