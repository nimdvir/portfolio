## Oh sweetie, don’t be modest. Of course you matter — to us. Julianne Moore, Hollywood’s red-hot star, appears in a new film (*Factotum*) and discusses life after 40 in an industry obsessed with youth.

Julianne Moore is exhausted. Although the day has barely started, she already feels like she’s walking into a firing squad. *“I’m tired, please have mercy on me,”* she pleads, perfume trailing, as she enters a meeting at the Regency Hotel in New York. The day ahead will be merciless: a battalion of journalists brandishing intrusive questions. *Factotum*, the film she’s promoting, had a chilly reception in the U.S., so much of the interview centers on **why**, **how much**, and **why now** Moore agreed to this role.

**– You spend much of the film in a nervous breakdown. Why is that?**  
“That’s what the script demanded — to cry constantly. That’s the job. You learn to inhabit the character, to understand why she is in the place she is. I don’t do it randomly, if that’s what you’re asking.”

A little background: Julianne Moore, now 46, is among the busiest actresses in cinema. Over the past two years she starred in four films (including *The Forgotten*, *The Prize Winner of Defiance*), and is set to star in five more in the next two. That, along with major endorsements for Revlon and Mont Blanc.

“I don’t think I overwork,” Moore sighs. “But due to distribution issues I know people feel they see me too often. So I did several films over two years, released close together — suddenly the media asks: ‘What’s wrong with her? Why must we see her all the time?’”

**– The American media seems softer on you. Why?**  
“It’s because I’m probably not particularly interesting. Today most attention goes to young people — the Jessica Simpsons of the world. At over 40, I’m probably outside the age window people talk about. Not that I do anything in my private life that’s thrilling.”

Moore, who lives in New York’s West Village with her partner (director-writer Bart Freundlich) and their two children, emphasizes she’s not a diva. “I’m like anyone else — family, home, work. When I come home, I can’t say to my child, ‘Sweetie, Mommy can’t talk to you now — she’s cried all day.’”

You’ve recently chosen roles filled with tears and anguish. In the past two years many of your characters break down.  
“I prefer those roles. It’s better to play someone emotionally charged than a flat, generic part. If the script is no good, that’s torture. I want layers, something I haven’t done. Bad script = torture.”

You’ve often been labeled “the hysterical mother.”  
“That’s wrong. *Far From Heaven*, *Magnolia*, *Safe* — I’ve done 30 films without motherhood themes. Yet every interview they ask: ‘How is it being a mom?’ It’s exhausting. Ask me my favorite color — anything but motherhood.”

**– Favorite color?**  
“Okay, enough. Let’s talk about the film.”

Let's talk. *Factotum*, opening this week in Israel, is a psychological thriller built around a major twist (unless you’re a *Law & Order* vet). Moore plays Brenda Martin, a struggling single mother whose car is stolen with her young son inside. As things spiral, racial tension erupts in the neighborhood.

As expected, Moore depicts collapse, largely unrecognized by those around her.  
**– Like *The Forgotten*?**  
“Oh, no — very different. One was sci-fi, one’s a thriller. This story is smarter, more intricate. A strong script is rare. I read 4–5 scripts weekly — most are weak.”

Moore was particularly drawn by the writer, Richard Price, who adapted his own earlier novel. The challenge: turning hundreds of pages into a tight film — much is cut, many motivations hidden. Audiences often expect clarity — “this one is evil, that one good” — but life doesn’t work that way.

That ambiguity is part of the film’s draw.  
“This is a film about people oppressed by poverty, forced into anger and neglect. For example, would Brenda act the same if she had money? And how much does racial context shift perceptions?”

In the film, Moore appears unglamorous, nearly makeup-free. Was that hard?  
She laughs. “I loved it. It’s refreshing to do something without mascara. Too much external nonsense in film — hair, makeup, lip gloss — it hides soul.”

**– But you also have a Revlon contract.**  
“I’m not against beauty, but the madness around appearance disturbs me. Celebrity mania is like bacteria. People seek stimuli, not substance. It’s a giant soap opera.”

Will audiences see more “the crying mother” in you? Your next film, *Trust the Man*, is a romantic comedy by your husband.  
Moore says business and pleasure merge — your life is always material for art. *Trust the Man* is about two couples navigating conflict. She jokes that in her life “my husband simply looked around and found material.”

Even here, we circle back to family and identity — the same themes always asked.
