There are families who bring out *kubbeh* or *gefilte fish* for big events.  
In the Kardashian family – special and different from others – they like to show off their backsides and their cameras.  
The family, which makes a fine living from reality TV, has turned televised humiliation into a full-fledged career.

After family matriarch Kris married Olympic athlete Bruce Jenner, she launched a lively socialite career and successfully passed her pushy social instincts down to her daughters.  
Kim was the first to break out as a model, actress, Paris Hilton’s best friend (for a second and a half), and star of a sex tape that made her the most famous butt in America.  
She was also featured in *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*, which showcased the family’s antics and became a major hit on E! Channel.  

After appearing in Kim’s show, Khloé and Kourtney decided they wanted one too. Enter *Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami*, a new reality series following the two sisters as they head to the party capital determined to conquer every corner of it.  

The direction, truth be told, is entirely business. Kourtney and Khloé own a boutique called **DASH**, where they sell designer clothing. The new show was launched to coincide with the opening of a Miami branch – meaning that all the yacht outings and party chatter come with a heavy dose of business promotion.

## Interview with Khloé Kardashian

Ahead of the show’s Israeli premiere (Thursday, 22:10, E! Channel), Khloé took a call for this interview – about two hours later than planned.  
In classic Hilton fashion, she quickly melted the tension.

**"Nimrod, I love you!"** she declared at the start of the call.  

**You don’t mean that.**  

“Really, I *do* love you. I didn’t mean to be late. My team gives me too much work, and sometimes there’s a mix-up in scheduling. But now I’m completely with you.”  

**If you’re completely with me, why do I hear a hairdryer in the background?**  

“Oh, that. I’m doing a photo shoot for *Radar* magazine right now, so I’m sitting in hair and makeup. But it’s fine – we can talk.”

As Khloé dries her hair, here’s some background: she’s 25, daughter of Kris and the late attorney Robert Kardashian.  
She came into fashion through her sister.  

“**Kourtney and I were stylists for years,**” she explains. “Then she opened a children’s clothing store, and afterward we decided to open one for women. The rest is history.”  

“**We sell clothes we love,**” she continues. “And also T-shirts, candles, and water bottles. Kourtney, Kim, and I do all the buying for the store, and at least one of us is there every day. We’re very involved.”

**So you really moved to Miami?**  

“Yes, really. Kourtney and I broke up with our boyfriends around the same time and wanted to channel our energy into business instead of men. I also got a radio show there – that was the highlight of the experience. Another platform for me to go wild, be spontaneous, and say whatever’s on my mind.”

**How did you get into reality TV in the first place?**  

“My mom is good friends with Ryan Seacrest (host of *American Idol*), who produces our show. One day, my mom brought him the idea, and he loved it. Basically, the show is my mom and Ryan’s baby. They did all the work – we just showed up,” she laughs.

**Isn’t it weird that your mom manages your career?**  

“I trust my mom one hundred percent. We never planned on doing a reality show, but it’s fun for us. Now it’s the most-watched show on E! and our Miami store is doing amazing. I guess my mom knows what she’s doing.”

## The Blonde Reality

Apparently, Kris doesn’t mind seeing her daughter act completely silly on TV – with wild parties, goofy comments, and the kind of blonde bloopers that drive up ratings. Khloé doesn’t mind either.  

“Everything you see is one hundred percent real,” she admits. “That’s my personality. Okay, it’s a little edited, but I stand behind it. Nobody tells me what to do on the show. What you see is who I am. I don’t take myself seriously.  

If I’m portrayed a certain way, who cares? I think I come across as a fun, open girl who does what she wants and says what’s on her mind. Honestly, there’s another side of me people don’t see. I can be bitchy. I’m sarcastic, but not everything makes it into the show.”

**One thing viewers didn’t see was your 2007 arrest for drunk driving.**  

“I believe everything happens for a reason,” she says. “I made a serious mistake, but I grew up and took rehab very seriously. My message is: it can happen to anyone. Don’t drink and drive.”

**What about ‘Don’t have sex and film it’? Because that’s what your sister Kim did – and it went global.**  

“Um… I don’t want to talk about that. I’m proud of my sister, no matter what she does. I’ve learned not to take this business too seriously. The tabloids don’t know me or my family. They’re just critical people who need to sell magazines, and that’s fine. It’s all part of the game. I don’t care if they’re nice or mean to me. I have my family and friends, and I don’t have to prove anything to anyone.”
