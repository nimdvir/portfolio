*Megan Hilty and Katharine McPhee, stars of the musical-drama “Smash,” compete for the role of Marilyn Monroe in the series but remain good friends in real life. “The theater is a scandalous world where everyone is always close. That intimacy is what fuels the drama,” they say in response to rumors of tension.*

## Introduction

If you missed *Smash*’s first season — the musical, trashy, addictive show on NBC (airing in Israel on HOT3) — you might not realize the behind-the-scenes storm it created. The show, whose story unfolds around a Broadway production inspired by **Marilyn Monroe’s** life, offers a vivid peek into the world of musical theater.

At its heart are the producers (Angelica Huston, Debra Messing, and Christian Borle) and two ambitious actresses fighting for stardom: **Megan Hilty** and **Katharine McPhee**.

## The Interview

### Q: Are you two as competitive off-screen as your characters seem to be?  
**Megan Hilty:** We’re very close friends. People always ask if we’re competitive with each other, but we’re not our characters. Our roles — Karen and Ivy — will always have a complicated relationship, but we’re like two twelve-year-olds.

---

### Q: Surely, the rivalry must affect real life too?  
**Hilty:** Not at all. On Broadway, you see each other daily — auditions overlap, everyone competes for the same roles — but that’s just how the business works.  
**McPhee:** I’m known as the girl who stabs backs — I joke about it. In Hollywood, competition is distant. On Broadway, it’s personal because everyone knows everyone.

---

### Q: How would you describe your characters?  
**Hilty:** Ivy Lynn is a seasoned Broadway fox, a natural blonde who idolizes Marilyn as her muse.  
**McPhee:** Karen Cartwright is a small-town girl from Iowa. She’s pure, inexperienced — until she sings, and suddenly angels fall from the sky.

---

### Q: Some critics say the show distorts Broadway reality.  
**Hilty:** We’re not making a documentary. It’s entertainment. But theater *is* a scandalous world — people dressing, undressing, rehearsing together — that intimacy naturally breeds drama.

---

### Q: Katharine, did you ever imagine yourself as Marilyn Monroe?  
**McPhee:** Never. I leave that to Megan. I don’t have her look or presence. But I think I captured Marilyn’s essence — her vulnerability. Still, acting is brutal: people judge your soul. It’s 95% unemployment and 5% magic.

---

### Q: You both came from different worlds — Broadway and Hollywood. How did that shape your collaboration?  
**McPhee:** We never even talked about *American Idol*. Megan was focused and ready. I was new to this kind of intensity.  
**Hilty:** That’s true. It’s a different rhythm — constant rehearsals, recordings, and retakes. Like theater on caffeine.

## Season 2 and Beyond

Season two introduced a younger cast through a new musical, *Hit List*, reminiscent of *Rent* and *Spring Awakening*. The goal was to bring energy, youth, and contemporary storytelling. McPhee’s character finds herself in a romantic arc that, at first, lacked chemistry.

**McPhee:** At first, I hated him. We had no chemistry — and you can’t fake that. Luckily, it developed naturally, just like in the story.

## Spielberg’s Touch

Despite uncertainty about renewal, both stars express gratitude toward executive producer **Steven Spielberg**.

**Hilty & McPhee:** Steven is amazing. Whenever he visits set, there’s this aura — you can feel his passion for storytelling. He’s deeply involved.

## Life After *Smash*

### Q: What’s next if the show doesn’t return?  
**Hilty:** I’m finishing a new album and heading back to Broadway.  
**McPhee:** I want to explore more television. Maybe a play someday — but not musicals right away. For now, the camera is calling.
