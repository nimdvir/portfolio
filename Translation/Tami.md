# The Law of Politeness: Etiquette Priestess Tami Lancut-Leibovitz in a Polite Interview

*If you’ve ever wondered what kind of first impression to make at work, how to behave in a business meeting, or how often to tend to your nails — Tami Lancut-Leibovitz has all the answers.*

## A Personal Confession

Let me begin with a confession: I’m one of those who admire Tami Lancut-Leibovitz’s philosophy and read her books eagerly. In high school, I even attended one of her etiquette workshops (true story), which left a lasting impression on me.  

Perhaps that’s why much of her new book — a thousand-page guide titled *The International Business Language* — felt instantly clear to me.  

> “There’s a lot of logic and common sense in it,” she says. “I’m a very rational person who needs to understand the reasoning behind everything. That’s why I explain the logic of tying a necktie, hosting guests, or why the Chinese behave in certain ways in business. In my view, this book belongs in every respectable office.”

## A Comprehensive Life Philosophy

**Q:** What drives your approach to etiquette?  

**A:** I wouldn’t call it a science, but it’s based on well-founded principles combined together. It’s a mix of common sense and intuition. Not all rules are binding; sometimes it’s perfectly fine to break them — but knowing them is essential.  

> *“Etiquette is not about rigidity; it’s about understanding the logic behind behavior.”*

## The World Has Changed

**Q:** Your new book, *The I.B.L. Code* (TLL Publishing, 690 NIS), is your fifth on manners. What has changed to justify a new volume?  

**A:** The world today is different. Instant communication, youthful aesthetics, and speed define our time. We crave excitement; everything must be engaging. Yet, many people still don’t know how to behave professionally. In Israel, for example, people don’t plan meetings properly — they rarely define the agenda or participants in advance.  

> *“We crave excitement; we want everything to be engaging — even professionalism.”*

## Turning Manners into a Career

**Q:** How do you define yourself?  

**A:** You should never ask someone where they work or what their profession is — ask what they do.  
There are two reasons: first, to avoid embarrassment; second, because professions today are fluid. For instance, instead of saying I’m an image consultant, I say I work in management training, marketing, and personal branding in business, society, and politics.  

> *“In business, image is strategy. How you present yourself shapes the narrative before you even speak.”*

## How It All Began

**Q:** How did you get into this field?  

**A:** I grew up in the business world. My family owned a factory called “Etz HaZayit” (“The Olive Tree”). Professionally, I began as an interior designer — only instead of designing homes, I now design people.  

I later studied cosmetics, grooming, and communication. Etiquette legend **Hanna Bavli** helped me connect these worlds. She told me, “What are grooming, dress, and communication if not manners?” That insight shaped my career.

## Between Feminism and Femininity

**Q:** Do you see yourself as a feminist?  

**A:** I’m somewhere in the middle — partly for progressive womanhood, partly for the traditional kind. Despite all the progress, it’s still nice when a woman is treated like a woman. Many women today have become aggressive toward men. I think men miss the days when they had to court.  

> *“Modern equality doesn’t mean abandoning grace.”*

## The Art of Grooming

**Q:** You speak often about grooming. Why is it so important?  

**A:** Grooming is essential — it defines the first impression. I have fixed rituals in my Outlook calendar: regular hair appointments, manicures, skincare. I expect the same level of self-care from those I work with.  

> *“Good manners begin where good grooming starts.”*

## Family and Values

**Q:** How do you balance work and family?  

**A:** I’ve been divorced for twenty years and live alone. I have four children and two grandchildren — they’re my best friends. It wasn’t easy to build myself while raising four young children, but with work and support, I made it.

## The State of Politeness in Israel

**Q:** How polite is Israel, compared to other countries?  

**A:** In global etiquette rankings, we’re near the bottom. Everywhere else, manners are taught from childhood — here, people assume they already know everything. Don’t get me wrong, Israelis are wonderful people, but when it comes to manners, we still have much to learn.  

> *“A society without boundaries breeds confusion. Politeness is structure — not submission.”*

---

## Time, Culture, and Respect

**Q:** What does time management have to do with etiquette?  

**A:** I never go anywhere without a watch. A watch shows you manage your time — and there’s no shame in that. In meetings, it’s fine to check the time or even place your watch on the table.  

> *“Politeness,” she adds, “is the brake pedal for social decline.”*

## When Others Are Rude

**Q:** What’s your reaction when someone behaves rudely?  

**A:** I’m not horrified by rudeness, and I don’t correct people. But yes, some things annoy me — people talking loudly on phones, not pushing their chairs back, or interrupting others. Condescension is the worst form of rudeness.  

> *“True elegance is how you behave when others aren’t.”*

---

## Two Golden Rules

1. **Always Be Prepared** – Know the rules, shape your message, and present yourself confidently.  
2. **Always Be Polished** – Show up refined in both appearance and substance. Precision earns respect.  

> *“Treat others with respect and follow the rules — authenticity comes naturally after that.”*

## Never, Ever Be Caught Without a Business Card

### Business Meeting Etiquette from *“The Code”*

| Topic | Guideline |
|-------|-----------|
| Appearance | Don’t let clothes overshadow your message. Dress simply, neatly, and elegantly. |
| Watch | A watch is mandatory; a phone isn’t a substitute. |
| Business Cards | Always have one on-hand — 24/7, 365 days a year. |
| Listening | Be patient. Listen fully. Don’t interrupt or answer for others. |
| Handshake | Don’t shake across the table. Move around and approach the person. |
| Business Cocktail | Hold a drink in your left hand so your right is free for handshakes. |
| Respect | Treat others by role, not by age or gender. In business, there are no men or women — only positions. |
| Electronic Communication | Reply to emails promptly (within 24 hours). Follow up the day after receiving a business card. |
