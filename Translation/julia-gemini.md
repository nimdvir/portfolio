## I'm Back

Two years have passed since Julia Louis-Dreyfus was diagnosed with breast cancer. She shared her recovery process with her followers, and in parallel filmed the final season of the comedy Veep. In an interview with Shishabat, she talks about the connection between comedy and politics and admits: 'To be a middle-aged woman trying to stay relevant and influential.'

The past year has been far from smiles for Julia Louis-Dreyfus, a woman who treats life with constant humor. 'When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I started to cry,' she says about the discovery of the malignant disease in her body in 2017. It's not easy to see a comedian cry, but Dreyfus, after completing six chemotherapy treatments and surgery, already sounds and looks recovered.

'The treatments and the surgery were very difficult. I felt sick to my core, but I always knew I was going to get through it, that I had to get through it.' Of course, cancer makes you think. We are not the same when we see the end in front of our eyes. I saw death. You could say that before the illness I was much more lighthearted, but the illness made me realize that lightheartedness is not something I can afford. It's not that I'm heavy, I'm just much more aware and goal-oriented.' Dreyfus, who shared her journey with her fans on social media, said this week in an interview on the show 'Good Morning America': 'I think I reached a lot of people. I raised a lot of money for women who have undergone mastectomy and reconstruction.

Next week she returns to the screen in the seventh and final season of the political comedy she stars in, 'Veep'. 'I never had a doubt for a second that this season would reach the screen,' she says, 'if anything, the cancer gave me motivation. They say that humor is the best medicine, and that's not a clich√©. I needed laughter in my life, this goal.'

Since she first appeared as Elaine Benes in 'Seinfeld,' Dreyfus (58) has become one of the most acclaimed actresses in history, with a record-breaking number of Emmy Awards (nine for 'Seinfeld,' six of them for her acting) and other honors. After several seasons on the series 'The New Adventures of Old Christine,' she stepped into the shoes of the seasoned politician Selina Meyer in the successful 'Veep.' In the final season, her character is once again running for President of the United States, surrounded by her incompetent team and armed with a cynical approach to life. The season has Meyer throwing a variety of inappropriate jokes into the air about the disabled, victims of shooting attacks, the lower class, and anyone who crosses her path. All she cares about is the White House.

'You could say I've made a career out of playing pretty awful characters,' laughs Dreyfus when we meet this week in a New York hotel. 'But even when Meyer is really awful, I don't see it that way. She's very determined and very, very frustrated. There's something interesting about frustration. Behind it, there's a lot of sadness and ambition. It's much deeper than just being 'awful.' So she takes out her frustration on everyone around her. From the final season of 'Veep.'

For example, a line of hers reprimanding one of the employees who messed up: 'It's like using a croissant as a dildo - it doesn't do the job and it leaves a mess\!'' she bursts out laughing. You talk about her as if she's a real person. 'She exists. We see her everywhere around us. She's a combination of many women and men in politics and other industries. You could say it's a series about Hollywood too, not just about Washington. A series about selfish people trying to advance themselves in any way possible.'

**How similar are you to Selina?**

'A lot, tons,' she laughs. 'I can especially identify with her. I understand her frustration - to be a woman who is busy all day with how to sell her brand. I do the same thing. There's a lot of similarity between surviving in politics and surviving in showbiz. Being a middle-aged woman trying to stay relevant and influential - I definitely understand the feeling. When people in front of you think you're over the hill and you should go home, or when they don't take you seriously - it's infuriating.'

**You, in your position, still feel that way?**

'Yes. I've always felt like I had to fight. It was hard for me to get the ability to produce my own material. I fought very hard to get creative control. There was a lot of pressure against me, but in the end I won.'

**What's the trick?**

'I can honestly say that I have tons of experience in entertainment. I'm full of confidence that I have a lot to add.'

Dreyfus is the undisputed boss of the series. The entire crew is at her feet - showering her with compliments and holding their breath when she walks on set. And still, it seems she works harder than anyone. In the hotel where the interview is taking place, she's been there since seven in the morning, without a break. Skipping between interviews for media from around the world, meeting with the series' producers, finalizing the editing of the upcoming episodes. Dreyfus takes off her high heels and remains barefoot. She sits next to the producer in the hotel hallway, watching scenes on the laptop screen - and giving editing instructions. 'I hear 'ahem' too many times,' she remarks and suggests shortening a scene. From there she continues with the round of interviews, and it's clear that there's not a bit of fatigue in her. 'A good leader is one who manages to set an example,' says Tony Hale, who plays her right-hand man in the series. 'Julia is like that. She's never off. She never has a bad day. And even if she does, you'll never know. She comes to work.' Dreyfus is modest: 'I think we all try to do the best we can. This is definitely not just my show. Everyone works very hard.'

**How does your role as a producer manifest itself?**

'It's a never-ending role. I'm involved in everything. At least I've changed. In the past, I used to watch all the scenes that were filmed on a given day, like a person possessed, but I learned to let go. When I used to watch myself, I would be filled with self-criticism, disgust, and shame. Today I'm not so hard on myself at that level.' It seems you work harder than everyone. 'It's important to me, on a personal level. After the original creator of the series (Armando Iannucci; N.D.) left after the fourth season, I felt that someone needed to take the reins. I had to take command. I'm glad I did it, that I pushed HBO to continue. I'm very proud of that. 'I really appreciate all the people who work with me, and it's important to me to be a kind of example or inspiration to them. This product is the result of the joint work of 200 people, and that, in my opinion, is the magic of television. On the face of it, it seems impossible to get 200 people to do anything. And yet, we manage to put out episodes.'

**Why are you finishing?**

'It was my decision and the producers' decision. The network was willing to let us continue, but I felt that the series had run its course. We're ending at a point where I think we should end.'

**Is there a connection to the fact that reality itself has become satirical to an extent that surpasses the scripts?**

'Given the current climate, it's much more challenging to try to break comedic boundaries. On the other hand, we have always operated in the series without addressing the political identity of the characters. None of them are defined on a particular side of the political divide, and we live in a restrictive universe that helps us advance the story, especially now. In my opinion, this is the key to the question of why our series has been running for many seasons. As far as we're concerned, everyone is invited to the 'party' we hold on screen in every episode. 'There's no doubt that reality is much tougher today. When we started, it was the Barack Obama administration, and look what's happening in the White House today. All sorts of things we laughed about on the show have become unfunny jokes in reality. The current climate definitely affects the feeling. Maybe it's not funny anymore. Donald Trump is not funny in my opinion. I mean, he could have been funny if he didn't have the power he has.'

I understand you're not a big fan of the current president. 'To put it mildly. It's reflected in everything he does.'

**Is there anything in common between you, as the on-screen president, and him?**

'The only thing is that we're both pretend presidents. He's also playing a president. He's a pretend president, in pretense.' Although the spirit of Trump hovers over, there is no mention of him in the current season. 'That's on purpose. From the beginning, the idea was not to represent reality in an absolute way, but to be a satire on politics in general. This is actually the first season in which Trump was a part of our lives. He was elected in 2016, after the previous six seasons had already been written. This season was written in 2017, and it was very difficult to ignore what Trump was doing. Everywhere in the world people ask me about him, he has become the face of America. It's very sad in my opinion. I didn't want to take part in that.'

**Do you find yourself laughing at the news, which, as mentioned, surpasses every line in the script?**

'Yes, there are times when that's exactly what I think to myself. Suddenly I feel that it's so extreme, even for our show. And still, it's important for me to note that I play a woman who served as president of the United States, and that's already a reality we don't know, it's a boundary that hasn't been crossed yet. 'I do feel that the infrastructure is there, that the ground has been prepared. Without going into detail, I think that this is already a situation that was taken into account in the episodes of the new season. In many cases, the series touches on all sorts of real scenarios, whether intentionally or not, and that's the character throughout the period that we're on the air.'

**Do you find a similarity between actors and politicians?**

'Definitely, you're a kind of brand that relies on relevance, you sell an image to the public. You're in a constant struggle to stay in the game. Every congressman who is elected wants to keep his place, and his head is already in the next campaign. An actor who gets a job also starts thinking about the next project so as not to remain unemployed. 'In both cases, you depend on the current role, which will actually dictate which role you'll move on to next. Add gender to the equation - I'm a woman who has been working in the industry for four decades, and as I get older it becomes harder to stay in the picture. This is also true for politics. Maybe in Washington it actually adds power to women, as experienced and connected from their years, but that's only true for very specific women in specific positions of power.'

**Why, in fact, not bring the reality outside into the series?**

'Because it's a political satire and not a parody commentary on the existing situation. I love parody, and certainly in everything related to the wonderful work they do on 'Saturday Night Live,' but that's not our series. 'I grew up and learned a lot in my three years on 'Saturday Night Live,' in the early 80s. The competition was brutal, it was not a friendly environment for women, to put it mildly. It was a wild, drug-fueled scene that I didn't connect with, but it helped me to sharpen what I do want to do as an actress. In the last year there I met Larry David, and then I found a partner for my misery. 'But in 'Veep' you can't compete with reality, and in fact we don't mention any president who came after Ronald Reagan. We have a fictional history. This proved itself in retrospect, because the US is so divided - and yet everyone can feel that their political position is supposedly represented. 'We have consultants who worked in the Obama administration and the Bush administration before him. I get reactions from both political ends, each one is happy with how much we laugh at the expense of the other side. I'm amused every time it happens, because it's proof that we're doing a good job.'

**Do you feel that you represent American politics as a result of the series?**

'When I travel to foreign countries, they always ask my opinion on Trump. Even before they recognize me as Julia the actress, as soon as they hear me speaking English with a distinct American accent, they first want to know my opinion on Trump. Apparently, that's the thing that fascinates people outside the US the most. Of course, they also recognize me from 'Seinfeld' or other characters I've played over the years. I was on a ski vacation in the Austrian Alps, and maybe because of the snowy atmosphere there was someone there who recognized me from 'Christmas Vacation' (a 1989 Christmas movie, in which she starred alongside Chevy Chase; N.D.). That was unexpected.'

She wasn't supposed to be in 'Seinfeld' originally. The idea was to do a show that was all men, but the NBC network insisted on including a female character - and Elaine felt like an unwanted addition. 'It took me a while to find my place,' she says about her days on the legendary series. 'The truth is that for years I felt that they weren't giving me jokes with 'meat' there. I had jokes, but they weren't as strong as the men's, in my opinion.' And yes, she admits that some of the time she felt like she was in a boys' club. 'Many times I heard Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld say that they write Elaine as if she were a guy.'

Dreyfus is known as a mentor to successful female comedians of the new generation, such as Amy Schumer or Abbi Jacobson from 'Broad City.' Jacobson even said about her in an interview: 'The characters we created in 'Broad City' are a direct result of watching Julia and understanding that it's okay to 'be like that' as a woman.' Dreyfus is modest: 'I don't think I 'held the door' for anyone. I don't even understand what that means. Everyone earns their place honestly. I do see progress in the entertainment industry. There are many more roles for women in comedy than there were 20 or 30 years ago. There are roles that are not just being 'the wife of' or the hot friend. Most of the characters I've played were single. I'm quite averse to 'admiring girlfriend' roles.'

**Jerry Seinfeld once said that political correctness is nonsense and 'anti-comedy.' Do you agree?**

'Absolutely not. I'm in favor of political correctness. You could even say that I'm a little suspicious of people who oppose it. I think they're actually saying that it's okay to tell racist jokes or jokes about violence against women. That's really not okay.'

Well-founded gossip has given Louis-Dreyfus the image of a wealthy heiress, a descendant of a billionaire family. Her father, William, managed the Louis Dreyfus Group from 1996 to 2006 - an investment company with holdings in real estate, gas, media, and more. 'The media reports about my father's wealth are greatly exaggerated,' she says defensively. 'They like to write about him being a billionaire, and they often write about me as a billionaire heiress. That's really not the case. Far from it.' On the other hand, when her father passed away a decade ago, he may not have left behind billions, but it's undeniable that this is a wealthy-plus family. The art collection that was in the father's country house in upstate New York alone was valued at $50 million.
