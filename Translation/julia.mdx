### 💬 Key Interview Highlights

<Callout type="question" title="How do you talk about Selina Meyer as if she’s real?">
Selina Meyer is everywhere around us. She’s a mix of politicians and Hollywood types — selfish people trying to promote themselves at all costs.  
</Callout>

<Callout type="question" title="How similar are you to Selina?">
A lot. I know frustration. Like her, I constantly sell my brand. Surviving in politics is similar to surviving in show business. Being a middle-aged woman trying to stay relevant and impactful — I understand that very well.  
</Callout>

<Callout type="question" title="And even now, with your status, you still feel you need to fight?">
Yes. I always had to fight for control of my work. It was tough, but I won.  
</Callout>

<Callout type="question" title="Why end Veep now?">
It was my decision with the producers. HBO wanted to continue, but I felt the show had reached its natural end.  
</Callout>

<Callout type="question" title="Has reality become too satirical for the show?">
Today’s climate makes it harder to push comedic boundaries. But our neutrality — no party labels, no direct references — allowed the series to last.  
</Callout>

<Callout type="question" title="Is there a connection between Selina Meyer and Donald Trump?">
The only thing is that we’re both “pretend presidents.” He’s president in a show too.  
</Callout>

<Callout type="question" title="What about Israel?">
I’ve never been, but I’d love to visit. My grandfather was Jewish, but I don’t identify as Jewish. It’s part of my heritage — but only one part.  
</Callout>
