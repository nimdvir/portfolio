Eva Mendes is widely regarded as one of Hollywood’s beauties, starring in glamorous films and campaigns for Revlon, among others. But in *The Place Beyond the Pines*, directed by Derek Cianfrance, she intentionally appears less glamorous than we are used to seeing her in *Training Day*, *Ghost Rider*, *The Other Guys*, *We Own the Night*, and *Last Night*.

## Into the Role

In *The Place Beyond the Pines*, Mendes (aged 39 at the time) plays a married woman from a small upstate New York town, raising her infant son — the child of a casual encounter with her real-life partner, Ryan Gosling, who in the film is portrayed as a stunt motorcyclist drawn to crime. Bradley Cooper also stars as a police officer; while the men maintain polished appearances, Mendes intentionally submits to a grittier, less polished look for her character.

She describes how she prepared: she worked as a waitress in a real diner full-time, from morning until night, covered in oil and coffee stains, clearing tables and serving customers like any other server.

**Q: Why put yourself through that?**  
She answers that she wanted the role badly and wanted to enter it as authentically as possible. She saw the part as transformative, an opportunity to work with the director, Gosling, and Cooper — to be part of this film. She didn’t mind looking less glamorous for that. She felt a personal intimacy with the crew and recognized it as a dream role.

## On-Screen Partnership

**Q: How did it feel to act on-screen opposite your real-life partner?**  
She declines to answer directly, calling it “too personal.” She will say, though, that walking onto set on the first day, she didn’t feel as though everything was strange or foreign — instead, she felt immediately comfortable and at home.

## Moral Conflicts

In the film, Mendes’s character faces a dilemma: whether to choose the biological father of her child, who is unstable, or choose someone else who isn’t the biological parent but can offer security and stability. Although Mendes has no children in real life, she admits that the script triggered personal reflections.

She says it IS strange — she’s not a real mother — yet reading the script made the “logical step” seem like choosing stability. But after talking with mothers, she realized many women feel a deeply primal instinct to keep the biological parent in the picture. She says that instinct is almost animalistic in that sense. Her character clearly struggles with choice.

**Q: Did filming with Ryan make you feel how it might be to raise a child with him?**  
She replies: “No. It’s all imagination. I don’t know now what it would be like to build a family any more than I know how to rob a bank. It’s a performance, and I don’t bring set life into my personal life.”
