Julianne Moore is exhausted. Her day has barely begun, and she already feels as though she’s arrived at a firing squad. "I’m tired, please have mercy on me," she pleads as she enters the Regency Hotel in New York, trailing a cloud of sweet perfume.

To be fair, she deserves the sympathy: after all, it’s no easy feat to face a full day of press with a swarm of journalists armed with sharp questions.

Her new film *Freedomland* (Hebrew release: *“Shadows in the Dark”*) has been met in the United States with a rather cool critical reception. Thus much of the interview centers on why, how and to what extent Moore was drawn to take on this movie.

**“In the movie you’re in a state of breakdown throughout. Why exactly?”**  
“It’s the script, and that’s what they asked of me — to cry constantly. That’s my job. You learn to enter the character, understand why she’s where she is. I don’t do it for nothing, if that’s your question.”

Now, a bit of background: Julianne Moore, 46, is one of the busiest actresses in the film industry. For years she’s delicately walked the line between serious Actress-with-depth and glamorous model. In the past two years alone she’s taken leading roles in four different films (including *The Forgotten*, *The Prize Winner of Defiance*) and five more are scheduled to release in the coming years — not to mention her fat endorsement deals with Revlon and Montblanc.

“I don’t think I work *too much*,” Moore sighs. “But because of various distribution issues I’m aware there’s a feeling of being overexposed. So I made several films in two years, they all happened to be released around the same time, and suddenly the media asks ‘What’s wrong with her? Why are we seeing her all the time?’”

**“Yet it seems that the U.S. media is somewhat kind to you.”**  
“That’s because I’m probably *not* that interesting. When you think about it, most attention these days goes to young people — the Jessica Simpsons of the world. Probably because much of the fascination comes from young people themselves. When you’re sixteen, Jessica Simpson seems like the most interesting thing there is. As you grow older things become less important. At forty-something I’m likely completely outside the age bracket people talk about. Not that I’m doing anything radically exciting in my personal life.”

Moore, who lives in the West Village in New York with her partner, director-screenwriter Bart Freundlich, and their two children, is keen to state she’s not just some starlet.  
“I’m like everyone else,” she says. “I have a family and a home and a job like many people. When I go home I can’t tell my child ‘Honey, mommy can’t talk to you right now, she’s been crying all day.’”

**“Lately you seem to pick roles based on how much crying there is.”**  
“You could say I prefer roles like that. I’d rather play someone wild or emotional — someone *something happens to* — than a flat, two-dimensional character. If the script is bad, that’s torture. Pure torture to work with a bad script. I’d rather there’s development, something I haven’t done before.”

**“Yet many see you type-cast as the ‘hysterical mother’.**  
“That’s a mistake. *Far From Heaven*, *Magnolia*, *Safe*. Shall I go on? I’ve done thirty films without mothers. Sure, there are many stories about families, and many without families — and there’s no relation to the character choice. Oh my God!! Forgive me, but they ask me about motherhood in every interview. How did parenting affect me, what’s the effect, etc. I feel like I’m being interviewed for *Parents & Children* magazine. Ask me my favorite colour – anything but how it is being a mom.”

**“What’s your favourite colour?”**  
“Oh God, let’s talk about the movie.”

Let’s indeed. *Freedomland*, releasing this week in Israel, is a psychological thriller built around a twist (unless you’ve grown up on *Law & Order*, in which case the solution starts to make noise in the opening credits). Moore plays Brenda Martin, a single, low-income mother whose car is stolen while her young son sleeps in the back seat. As she sinks into every parent’s nightmare, Brenda enlists the help of a hardened cop (Samuel L. Jackson) and a volunteer mother (Edie Falco), and inadvertently sparks a racial firestorm between Black and white neighbors. Moore, as we said, plays her in various states of meltdown, stemming, among other things, from the fact that no one believes her.

**“Reminds a bit of your previous movie, *The Forgotten*, doesn’t it?”**  
“Oh please, don’t compare. One was sci-fi, the other is a thriller. The story here is entirely different — structured more like a detective mystery. Here’s a story I find smart and interesting. A good script isn’t something you stumble upon every day. I read four or five a week and I can say for sure there are very bad ones out there. This is what happens when everyone thinks they can write.”

**“One of the reasons you took this project was the writer, Richard Price, right?”**  
“Yes. He’s terrific. What he did eight years ago, writing the novel version of *Freedomland*, is incredible. When Joe Roth heard about the book he immediately bought the rights. Later, when the book became a bestseller, Price was brought back in to write the screenplay — what he calls ‘one of the hardest jobs I’ve ever had.’”

**“The movie, however, doesn’t fully answer many of the book’s questions.”**  
“It’s not an easy job — to take 500 pages and turn them into a 90-minute film. We had to cut many scenes, and yes, some things were lost. In movies things happen faster. That’s the difference between books and cinema — and there’s nothing wrong with it in my view. Sometimes audiences expect clarity, a definitive answer. That’s the good guy, that’s the bad guy, that’s what happened — end. But life isn’t like that. Not everything has an answer. That’s exactly what draws me – that this film has so many layers and a message.”

“This is a movie about people oppressed by poverty that leads them to anger and neglect. My character and everything she goes through because of her son disappearing — would it have happened if she had money? I’m not sure. Would she have behaved the same way, including the major secret revealed at the end, had the circumstances been different? There’s also the issue of black and white tension. Would the police have reacted the same if the kid wasn’t white and the abductor not black?”

**“In the film you spend most of your time crying and looking pale. How hard was it to make a whole film without make-up?”**  
Moore laughs. “I loved it! It was easy. Nice to make a film without mascara. Sometimes I think there’s too much external nonsense in films. You can’t even see anyone’s face under all that lip-gloss! For me makeup isn’t attractive. For me the best is natural.”

**“How does that sit with your Revlon contract?”**  
“I’m not against grooming of course, but what bothers me is the mania around the external look. What you see in all these tabloids: actors chasing form rather than substance. That’s the situation — you can’t deny there’s public interest in people who look good. I recently heard someone say that celebrity culture spreads globally like bacteria. It probably stems from people wanting something interesting to watch. It’s like one big soap opera. All about instant stimulation, not content.”

**“So, are you done with the ‘crying mother’ phase once and for all or should we expect more?”**  
The next step, it seems, is romance. Her upcoming film *Trust the Man* is a romantic comedy written and directed by her husband. Moore says it’s impossible to keep business and pleasure separate when you live with a writer. “It’s about relationships — two couples going through a crisis at the same time. I understand my husband — he was simply looking for inspiration and found it closest to him. As for me — every time I go on Letterman or talk to the press I end up talking mostly about family. Here I am again.”
