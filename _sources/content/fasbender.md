# Michael Fassbender: “I Hope Humanity Has Changed”

*Michael Fassbender’s third collaboration with director Steve McQueen might just earn him an Oscar. In “12 Years a Slave,” the actor plays a ruthless plantation owner who, true to his time, brutally mistreats his slaves. In this interview, Fassbender expresses his hope that such cruelty is behind us — and admits that using such a role as personal therapy would have been “quite perverse.”*

## A Shattering Experience

For many, watching *12 Years a Slave* is a deeply unsettling experience. Steve McQueen’s new film tells the true story of Solomon Northup (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery in the American South of 1841. The violence and emotional intensity of the film linger long after the credits roll.

If it’s hard for the audience to watch, one can only imagine what it was like for **Michael Fassbender**, McQueen’s frequent collaborator (after *Hunger* and *Shame*), who plays Edwin Epps — a sadistic Louisiana plantation owner.

> “Honestly, by the end of filming, I mostly felt relief,” he says. “I was glad it was over and hoped we had created something worth preserving. Steve has this way of working where, by the end of the day, you leave everything on set. When I got home, I was already thinking about the next project.”

## A Powerful Partnership

The 36-year-old Fassbender, born in Germany and raised in Ireland, is best known for roles like the young Magneto in *X-Men: First Class*, the Spartan in *300*, and the Nazi hunter in Tarantino’s *Inglourious Basterds*. Still, his true artistic legacy is tied to McQueen.

> “Steve changed my life. I owe him everything,” he admits. “We developed chemistry very quickly. I draw endless inspiration from him — and I hope I give some back.”

**What makes him different from other directors you’ve worked with?**

> “He’s very demanding, but also deeply compassionate. He gives actors the freedom to follow their instincts. He creates a safe space to fail — and to fail better. Most of us actors have tricks we rely on, things that worked before. But Steve has this incredible bullshit detector. He forces you to strip away your defenses and keep it real.”

## Into the Darkness

After starving himself for *Hunger* and exposing himself both physically and emotionally in *Shame*, Fassbender took another step forward in *12 Years a Slave* — portraying an unflinchingly violent man, particularly toward women. The role earned him an **Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor**.

> “It’s an intense role, but I kept my distance from it,” he explains. “It would have been quite perverse, I think, to use this character as a kind of therapy. This story matters deeply, so I approached Epps with respect and responsibility. I wanted to honor Solomon and all the enslaved people — you could almost feel their spirits moving through the fields.”

## Master of the Whip

**You show impressive mastery of the whip in the film.**

> “I had to train for that. The whip was nearly two meters long, and you have to control it carefully because it can snap back at you. I practiced a lot — just like Chiwetel practiced playing the violin, I practiced cracking the whip.”

## Humanizing the Monster

**Despite his cruelty, there’s a trace of misery in Epps.**

> “Exactly. I wanted to include a human element so viewers could recognize a spark of themselves in him — and then go home thinking, maybe we should treat each other better. Of course, Solomon’s suffering is horrific, but even those who inflicted pain paid a price. Their souls were damaged.
> Even my on-screen wife (played brilliantly by Sarah Paulson) is ultimately tragic. Their marriage is broken, they’re childless, and her husband cheats on her. She reacts out of fear and insecurity.
> Epps is the same — driven by fear. He’s in love with Patsy, one of his slaves, but can’t handle it, so he destroys her. It’s a complex world. Slavery wasn’t just about masters and slaves — it was the economic backbone of a nation.”

## Has Humanity Changed?

**Do you think slavery or such cruelty could ever return?**

> “I hope humanity has changed since then. History shows that people are capable of both incredible kindness and unspeakable cruelty. Even today, there are sweatshops where children make the clothes we wear in the West. That’s a kind of slavery too, I suppose. But I hope we’ve learned to work together for better purposes.”

## Life in the Fast Lane

When not playing sadistic plantation owners, Fassbender splits his time between **London and Los Angeles**, traveling the world and indulging his love for **extreme sports and racing**.

> “I love riding motorcycles, I’m learning to surf, I love exploring new cultures and people,” he says. “As soon as I wrap a film, I’m off on some new adventure. I’ve always been athletic and physical. I’m really into karting and motorsport — it’s the closest I’ll ever get to Formula 1. My dream is to write, direct, and star in a film about racing.”

## Fame, Family, and Focus

**What about personal life — marriage, family?**

> “It’s like wanting to have your cake and eat it too. I’ve got this wonderful career I’ve always dreamed of, but I’ve sacrificed things along the way. Who knows — maybe I’ll meet someone and fall in love. But for now, my focus is on work.
> I waited years for this chance, and now that it’s here, I want to make the most of it. Every artist has a prime period of creativity — before and after which there’s preparation or decline. This is my time, and I want to stay in it.”

## Toward an Oscar?

**You’re also nominated for an Oscar — proof you’re at your creative peak.**

> “I couldn’t ask for a better place to be. When I started acting at 17 or 18, this was the dream. Now I get to work with the best people in the business, and I’ve got this great partnership with Steve. He brings out the best in me. I think he’s made something truly beautiful — a film that moves people deeply. That’s the greatest prize of all.”

---

**Will there be a fourth collaboration between you and McQueen?**

> “I really hope so. I love working with him. For me, if Steve calls — I say yes, no questions asked. I agreed to *12 Years a Slave* before even reading the script. He just said it was about slavery, and I immediately said, ‘Of course.’ It’s vital to be part of projects like this, alongside the more entertaining ones.”
