<p>Despite the need to engage users and create engaging technologies, there is no agreed upon definition of the construct.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?l3X4Xm">(O’Brien &amp; Toms, 2008)</a></p>
<p>While information interaction focuses on the user experience with content, engagement is an expression of that interactivity. While some of the other frameworks stress the meaningfulness of the experience (i.e., aesthetics and flow), an engaging experience may make a lasting impression but have no more meaning than that the experience was enjoyable or challenging.</p>

<p>engagement attribute</p>
<p>Our definition of an engagement attribute is a characteristic of the user-computer [information interaction] that influences or is a component of the engagement. Engagement attributes are products of users’ interactions with the technology, since they depend on what the user finds innately compelling.</p>

<dt>Information interaction</dt>
<dd>Interaction pertains to the communication between the user and the computer interface (Schneiderman, <a href="https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.albany.edu/doi/full/10.1002/asi.20801#bib52">1997</a>), where the interface is the medium enabling user experiences. The interface represents the union of information design (i.e., how data is categorized, presented, and made meaningful to the user), interaction design (i.e., how the information tells a story), and sensorial design (i.e., the techniques employed to stimulate and utilize the five senses; Shedroff, <a href="https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.albany.edu/doi/full/10.1002/asi.20801#bib54">1994</a>). Information interaction is specifically the “process that people use in interacting with the content” of a system (Toms, <a href="https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.albany.edu/doi/full/10.1002/asi.20801#bib61">2002</a>, p. 855 ).</dd>

<dt>User engagement</dt>
<dd>A quality of user experience characterized by the depth of an actor’s investment when interacting with a digital system (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581918300041#bib0027">O’Brien, 2016a</a>). Engagement is more than user satisfaction: it is believed that the ability to engage and sustain engagement in digital environments can result in positive outcomes for citizen inquiry and participation, e-health, web search, e-learning, and so on. Yet user engagement (<abbr title="User Engagement">UE</abbr>) is an abstract construct that manifests differently within different computer-mediated contexts, and this has made it challenging to define, design for, and evaluate.</dd>

<p>Usefulness. (Nielsen ‘93). Usability applies to all aspects of a system with which a human might interact, including installation and maintenance procedures. It is important to realize that usability is not a single, one-dimensional property of a user interface. Usability has multiple components and is traditionally associated with the five usability attributes shown in figure 4. There are many other see for example see (Iivari and Koskela, 1987).</p>
<p>Usefulness is the issue of whether the system can be used to achieve some desired goal. It can again be broken down into the two categories of utility and usability. Utility is the question of whether the functionality of the system in principle can do what is needed, and usability is the question of how well users can use that functionality. (Nielsen ‘93).

<p>User research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies. Mike Kuniaysky further notes that it is “the process of understanding the impact of design on an audience.”</p>

<p>Information</p>
<p>The meaning that a human assigns to data by means of the known conventions used in their representation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?FKf40i">(Zins, 2007)</a></p>
<p>Data are a representation of facts or ideas in a formalized manner, and hence capable of being communicated or manipulated by some process. So: data is related to facts and machines ( Holmes, 2001). Information is the meaning that a human assigns to data by means of the known conventions used in its representation. Information is related to meaning and humans</p>
<p>(Holmes, 2001).</p>
<p>D-I are external phenomena; K are internal phenomena. This is the most common one. It underlies the rationale of the name “Information Science”; that is, Information Science is focused on exploring data and information, which are external phenomena. It does not explore knowledge, which is internal phenomena</p>
<p>Zins</p>
<p>Data are sensory stimuli that we perceive through our senses. Information is data that has been processed into a form that is meaningful to the recipient (Davis and Olson, 1985). Knowledge is what has understood and evaluated by the knower.</p>
<p>Zins</p>
<p>Data is a symbol set that is quantified and/or qualified. Information is a set of significant sings that has the ability to create knowledge… The essence of the information phenomenon has been characterized as the occurrence of a communication process that takes place between the sender and the recipient of the message. Thus, the various concepts of information tend to concentrate on the origin and the end point of this communication process (Wersig and Neveling, 1975). Knowledge is information that has been appropriate by the user… When information is adequately assimilated, it produces knowledge, modifies the individual’s mental store of information and benefits his development and that of the society in which he lives. Thus, as the mediating agent in the production of knowledge, the information, qualifies itself, in form and substance, as significant structures able to generate knowledge for the individual and his group</p>
<p>Data. In computational systems data are the coded invariances. In human discourse data are that which is stated, for instance, by informants in an empirical study. Information is related to meaning or human intention. In computational systems information is the contents of databases, the web etc. In human discourse systems information is the meaning of statements as they are intended by the speaker/writer and understood/misunderstood by the listener/reader. Knowledge is embodied in humans as the capacity to understand, explain and negotiate concepts, actions and intentions.</p>
<p>Knowledge is tacitly or consciously grasped and interiorized content of information related and meaningfully integrated into a unifying frame of experience among other information contents interiorized in the same way, the complex of which reflects subjective understanding of environment.</p>
<p>Data are representations of facts and raw material of information. Information is data organized to produce meaning. Knowledge is meaningful content assimilated for use. The three entities can be viewed as hierarchical in terms of complexity, data being the simplest and knowledge, the most complex of the three. Knowledge is the product of a synthesis in our mind that can be conveyed by information, as one of many forms of its externalization and socialization.</p>

<p>Datum is the representation of concepts or other entities, fixed in or on a medium in a form suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human beings or by automated systems (Wellisch, 1996). Information is (1) a message used by a sender to represent one or more concepts within a communication process, intended to increase knowledge in recipients. (2) A message recorded in the text of a document… Knowledge is knowing, familiarity gained by experience; person’s range of information; a theoretical or practical understanding of; the sum of what is known…</p>
<p>Data can arouse information and knowledge in our mind. Information is the change determined in the cognitive heritage of an individual. Information always develops inside of a cognitive system, or a knowing subject. Signs that constitute the words by which a document or a book has made are not information. Information starts when signs are in connection with an interpreter (Morris, 1938). Knowledge is structured and organized information that has developed inside of a cognitive system or is part of the cognitive heritage of an individual (based on C. S. Peirce, 1931, 1958).</p>
<p>Human-computer interaction (HCI) is defined by The Association for Computing</p>
<p>Machinery as a “discipline concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.” It can also be described as the study of the interactions between people (users) and information and communication technologies (ICT). Researchers in the field of HCI both observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways. As a field of research, human-computer interaction is situated at the intersection of computer science, behavioral sciences, marketing, design, media studies, and several other fields of study.</p>
