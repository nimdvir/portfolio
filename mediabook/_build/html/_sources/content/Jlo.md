#### Interview with Jennifer Lopez

# J.No

> *Maybe it suffices to remind Jennifer Lopez that before all the diamonds, the money, and the fame, she was just the little girl from the Bronx? Maybe it’s enough to hassle her with questions about her love of fur and her status as the number-one target of animal rights organizations? Maybe you should just ask her a few questions about working with Robert Redford in their new film **An Unfinished Life**, and we’ll leave it at that.*

> “I’m tired of in every interview with me they mention I’m from the Bronx. That’s something that will always follow me, because that’s where I come from and spent twenty years of my life there, yet I feel I’ve grown a lot since then.”

No one doubts that the distance between J.Lo and the block is as big as that between Sarit Hadad and the Hadera municipality. Yet Lopez still desperately maintains the pose of the “everyday girl” - the one who might have trouble dragging herself under the weight of diamonds, but still insists on staying real.  

Her new movie, *An Unfinished Life*, forces a close confrontation with that Lopez, who insists she’s still the same simple girl, who hasn’t let Hollywood’s glitz blow her head off. The same one who, at every opportunity, will seriously jabber about the difficulty of being famous. “Those paparazzi, you know.”

### The Protest

At the film premiere she walked right into the hall, refusing stubbornly to play the red carpet game. The reason - a violent protest was going on outside. Lopez, famous for her love of fur, had recently become the number-one target of animal activists.  

They came with models of slaughtered animals and signs reading: *“J. Lo, you are responsible for An Unfinished Life.”*  

When Lopez arrived, accompanied by her husband Mark Anthony, she snapped:  
> “I’m not doing the red carpet here.”

### The Film

In *An Unfinished Life*, directed by Lasse Hallström (*Chocolat*), Lopez plays Jean, a woman fleeing an abusive partner (Damian Lewis) with her daughter, moving to her late husband’s father’s ranch (Robert Redford), where they live alongside his injured friend (Morgan Freeman).  

Lopez stands out especially as a woman walking the line between strength and vulnerability, able to move as a mother wishing the best for her child, yet still making mistakes again and again.

### The Interview

At the press conference held at the Essex House near Central Park, Lopez arrived with bodyguards and assistants.  

**– How was it working with calibers like Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman?**  
“When I started filming, I was at a good place in my career so I could deal with those people. Because I was confident, the presence of Robert and Morgan didn’t make me nervous. Who did go crazy was my mother — she grew up on Robert Redford; for a while she lived for him. Since I was six I heard his name. That is kind of a dream for her.”  

**– We see you more and more in serious roles. Is that deliberate?**  
“Certainly. I’m not the same person I was five years ago. I’m very glad to be undergoing a process of maturation, because I feel it improves me. Depth comes with experience, and I feel age only helps me improve as an actress.”  

**– In the film you play a battered woman. Have you ever suffered abuse personally?**  
“Apart from the media, no one has abused me. But I can empathize with the efforts to find internal strength. All the characters in the film must face their own bear, which symbolizes some fear. I can totally understand that.”  

**– Speaking of fear, what do you think about what’s happening in New Orleans right now?**  
“My husband and I donated a lot of money to Katrina victims. Right now the focus is on supporting medical care for children. We’ll keep donating and also raise more support through my husband’s concerts.”  

**– So what’s going on with *you* now?**  
“Now I’m relaxing after a very tense period. I’m traveling, accompanying my husband on his tour. I decided work will stop being the center of my life. So I still answer calls, but let’s just say you can’t call me at 2:00 AM anymore.”  

**– Yesterday there was a crazy protest outside the hall. What do you have to say about that?**  
“No comment.”  

**– Don’t you at least want to explain what’s going on there?**  
“I’m not interested in talking about it at all.”
