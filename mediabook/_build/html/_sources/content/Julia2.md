>
> ### 💬 Key Interview Highlights
>
> **– How do you talk about Selina Meyer as if she’s real?**  
> Selina Meyer is everywhere around us. She’s a mix of politicians and Hollywood types — selfish people trying to promote themselves at all costs.  
>
> **– How similar are you to Selina?**  
> A lot. I know frustration. Like her, I constantly sell my brand. Surviving in politics is similar to surviving in show business. Being a middle-aged woman trying to stay relevant and impactful — I understand that very well.  
>
> **– And even now, with your status, you still feel you need to fight?**  
> Yes. I always had to fight for control of my work. It was tough, but I won.  
>
> **– Why end Veep now?**  
> It was my decision with the producers. HBO wanted to continue, but I felt the show had reached its natural end.  
>
> **– Has reality become too satirical for the show?**  
> Today’s climate makes it harder to push comedic boundaries. But our neutrality — no party labels, no direct references — allowed the series to last.  
>
> **– Is there a connection between Selina Meyer and Donald Trump?**  
> The only thing is that we’re both “pretend presidents.” He’s president in a show too.  
>
> **– What about Israel?**  
> I’ve never been, but I’d love to visit. My grandfather was Jewish, but I don’t identify as Jewish. It’s part of my heritage — but only one part.
