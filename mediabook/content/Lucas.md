### Setting the Scene  
Gay porn icon **Michael Lucas** filmed his new production, *Inside Israel*, against the backdrop of the country’s breathtaking landscapes.  
I met Lucas and his cast on set — and discovered the real reason behind his Zionist location choice: haven’t you heard that gay men make excellent tourists?

### Behind the Scenes at the Beach  
The porn industry loves its clichés, but one happens to be true: it’s not as easy as it looks. After spending an entire day on set with an international gay production in Israel, I can confirm — it’s complicated, exhausting, and strangely glamorous. But nothing to write home to your mother about.

The production in question, *Inside Israel* (and no, the main character isn’t named Israel), was directed and produced by New York–based porn star **Michael Lucas**. At 37, Lucas — a warm-hearted Jew who recently became an Israeli citizen — has built himself into a global brand.  

He began as a lawyer in Russia, moved through Germany and France, and eventually landed in New York. He started out acting in straight adult films but quickly realized where the real money (and creative freedom) was. His company, **Lucas Entertainment**, now ranks among the world’s leading gay porn studios, known for its unusually polished productions.

### Israel as a Backdrop and a Brand  
Lucas returned to Israel following the success of his previous film, *Men of Israel*, which he also shot locally with Israeli actors. That release became a major hit in the U.S. and left him eager for another round — this time, not just featuring Israeli men but Israel itself.  

The loose plot follows an international fashion photographer who comes to Israel for a photo shoot with models from around the world. Each photo session — naturally — ends in passionate sex. Shocking, I know.

Determined to showcase Israel in its full cinematic beauty, Lucas and his crew spent 11 days traveling from the **Golan Heights** and **Jordan River** to **Ga’ash Beach** (where we visited) and **Rosh HaNikra**. The schedule was unusually long for an adult film — a testament to its ambition. The project, expected to be released in late November, will likely be divided into three parts and accompanied by a photo book by Israeli photographer **Ronen Ackerman**, capturing the erotic journey across Israel.

### It’s All for the Gay Tourists  
From the outside, it may look like a sun-soaked fantasy, but the work itself is grueling. The crew hauled equipment through rugged terrain, filmed in blazing heat from sunrise to sunset, and shot each scene multiple times. And yes — those “performance-enhancing” tricks you’ve heard about? They’re real, and they go exactly where you think they do.

> “I’m making this film to encourage tourism to Israel,” Lucas told me.  
> “I love this country, I visit often, and I’m always amazed my friends in New York don’t realize how stunning it is.  
> I hope this film brings more gay tourism — which is both high-quality and highly profitable.”

### Hard Work, Satisfying Work  
“It’s a lot of fun to take part in a porn film,” said **Jonathan Agassi**, one of the Israeli actors.  
“It’s hard work, but also deeply satisfying. If you know your angles, your lighting, and your rhythm, it’s one of the most rewarding jobs there is.”

Lucas insists his production values match those of mainstream cinema.  
> “You can watch cheap porn online,” he said, “but there’s a real audience for premium content.  
> It’s like fashion — some buy Gucci, others shop at Walmart. I choose the best actors, the most beautiful locations, and make sure the environment is pleasant and professional. You can feel that energy on screen.”

### “It’s About Love — and Profit”  
When asked whether it’s profitable, Lucas smiled.  
> “If it weren’t, I wouldn’t still be doing it.  
> But this one’s different — I’m not sure it’ll even break even.  
> My motivation came from love for Israel. I hope that shows.”
